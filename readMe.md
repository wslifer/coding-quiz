This application is designed to be a helpful quiz for students taking coding classes. In this application you will have several questions to answer in an allotted time, every question you miss will take time off your remaining time. At the end of the quiz your time remaining will be the score you receive and will be saved on the page for your friends or you to try and beat the next time you take the quiz. 


No worries the scores will stay on the page for you to come back to at a later date and try again after a break. However, scores are only stored locally so you will not be able to compete with friends on different computers.
